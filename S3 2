# Module 6: S3 Bucket Versioning Assignment

## Problem Statement
You work for XYZ Corporation. Their application requires a storage service that can store files and publicly share them if required. Implement Amazon S3 for the same with versioning enabled to ensure file history is preserved.

## Tasks Performed

### 1. Enable Versioning on S3 Bucket
- Enabled **Versioning** on the existing S3 bucket that was created in the previous task.
- This allows multiple versions of an object to be stored and retrieved, even if the object is deleted or overwritten.

### 2. Upload Files to Test Versioning
- Re-uploaded 2 previously uploaded files to the same bucket.
- Verified that versioning created new versions of the files instead of replacing the originals.
- Each upload resulted in a unique version ID being assigned to the file.

## Outcome
S3 Bucket versioning was successfully enabled and tested. The bucket now stores multiple versions of the same object, ensuring better data protection and rollback capability.
