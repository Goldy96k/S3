# Module 6: S3 Bucket Creation Assignment

## 📝 Problem Statement
You work for XYZ Corporation. Their application requires a storage service that can store files and publicly share them if required. Implement Amazon S3 for the same.

## ✅ Tasks To Be Performed

1. **Create an S3 Bucket**  
   - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to create a new S3 bucket.
   - Ensure the bucket has a unique name and is created in your preferred region.

2. **Upload 5 Objects with Different File Extensions**  
   - Upload a variety of files to the S3 bucket, for example:
     - `.jpg` (image file)
     - `.txt` (text file)
     - `.pdf` (document file)
     - `.mp4` (video file)
     - `.csv` (data file)
   - Optionally, set public access permissions if required for sharing.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Secure, durable, and highly-scalable object storage.
- **Bucket Policies and Permissions**: Define access control and sharing capabilities.
- **Object Metadata**: Each file uploaded can include custom metadata.
- **Public Access Settings**: Managed at both the bucket and object level.

## 📷 Screenshots
> Include screenshots of:
- The created bucket
- The list of uploaded files
- Permissions tab if any file was made public

## 🔐 Security Note
Ensure the S3 bucket has appropriate permissions and avoid enabling public access unless required.
